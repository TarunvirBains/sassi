//! [`Punnu<T>`] — the typed in-memory pool.
//!
//! Holds `Arc<PunnuInner<T>>` so the public `Punnu<T>` is cheap to
//! clone and shareable across tasks; every clone observes the same
//! identity map, the same event stream, and the same configuration.
//!
//! # Concurrency
//!
//! The L1 storage is a [`std::sync::RwLock`] around an `LruCache`
//! rather than an async lock. Two reasons:
//!
//! 1. The spec calls `get` synchronous (§3.5) — `tokio::sync::RwLock`
//!    has no sync `read()`, so picking a sync lock is the only way to
//!    keep the public surface as designed.
//! 2. The `lru` crate's `get` method takes `&mut self` (it touches the
//!    LRU recency order on access), so even read-shaped operations
//!    need exclusive access to the map. A sync `RwLock<LruCache>`
//!    therefore behaves like a sync `Mutex<LruCache>` in practice;
//!    the `RwLock` shape leaves headroom for future LRU implementations
//!    that genuinely support `&self` reads (e.g., a clock-based variant)
//!    without changing the field type.
//!
//! Locks are held only across pure in-memory work (no awaits, no IO),
//! so a sync lock under an async runtime is safe.
