//! [`PunnuConfig`] — runtime configuration for a [`crate::punnu::Punnu`]
//! instance.
//!
//! Construction is via `PunnuConfig::default()` followed by struct-update
//! syntax, e.g.:
//!
//! ```
//! use sassi::PunnuConfig;
//! let cfg = PunnuConfig {
//!     lru_size: 64,
//!     ..Default::default()
//! };
//! ```
//!
//! All fields are public so consumers can read them back via
//! [`crate::punnu::Punnu::config`]. Defaults are tuned for "typical
//! native consumer" — 10k-entry LRU, 256-event channel, L1-only on
//! backend failure, last-write-wins on conflict, no TTL, no metrics.
//!
//! Several fields wire up across multiple tasks; their variants are
//! pinned here so the config shape is stable from v0.1.0-alpha.0
//! onward — adopters see the full surface, even though some hooks are
//! not yet load-bearing. Each field's doc comment names the specific
//! cluster/task that loads it:
//!
//! - [`PunnuConfig::default_ttl`] / [`PunnuConfig::ttl_sweep_interval`]
//!   — already load-bearing in Cluster A, Task 6.
//! - [`PunnuConfig::namespace`] — wired into `CacheBackend` keys in
//!   Cluster D, Task 13.
//! - [`PunnuConfig::metrics`] — hook called from `Punnu::insert` /
//!   `get` / `invalidate` in Cluster B, Task 8.
//! - [`PunnuConfig::backend_failure_mode`] — routing logic lives in
//!   Cluster D, Task 13 (`CacheBackend` integration).
